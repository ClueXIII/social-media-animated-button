### social media animated button
it's just an html and css social media button who can add to your website easily
<img draggable="false" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109299545/185746278-41aa32bb-9490-472c-88e6-dd737959edd6.gif">
## how does it work ?
You have just to add the body content of the hmtl code to your website.
According to your website, some modifications must be done in the css code.
If you have changes to be made, I wouldn't say no ;)
